                    The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said, “I and the sponsor of an orphan will be in Paradise like these two, and he pointed to the index and middle fingers, and separated them.” narrated by Muslim

                <p>
                    The number of orphans sponsored by the Charitable Activities Committee has reached more than 10,000 orphans inside and outside Bahrain (22 countries). These orphans reside with their families or in orphanages affiliated with reliable educational bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The committee supervises orphans who are sponsored outside Bahrain in cooperation and coordination with some well-known charitable societies and institutions in the international arena, and it also conducts periodic inspection visits to these institutions with the aim of following up on orphans abroad.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The committee has many examples of distinguished graduates at the high school or university level, and some of them became a donor .., and all of that with the blessing of the hand of charity that extended to them and nurtured them through this project.

                    Sponsoring orphans has many dimensions. In addition to the great reward of the Lord of the worlds, sponsoring orphans contributes to the reform of society when the orphan becomes a good individual and is protected from displacement and loss.
