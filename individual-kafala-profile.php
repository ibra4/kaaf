                The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said, “I and the sponsor of an orphan will be in Paradise like these two, and he pointed to the index and middle fingers, and separated them.” narrated by Muslim
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of orphans sponsored by the Charitable Activities Committee has reached more than 10,000 orphans inside and outside Bahrain (22 countries). These orphans reside with their families or in orphanages affiliated with reliable educational bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The committee supervises orphans who are sponsored outside Bahrain in cooperation and coordination with some well-known charitable societies and institutions in the international arena, and it also conducts periodic inspection visits to these institutions with the aim of following up on orphans abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was launched with the beginning of the committee’s work in 1970, and since 1991 the Charitable Activities Committee has systematically implemented the project of sponsoring orphans, which has achieved great benefits for thousands of orphans whose faces were filled with joy and prayed to their sponsors with goodness and blessing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The committee has many examples of distinguished graduates at the high school or university level, and some of them became a donor .., and all of that with the blessing of the hand of charity that extended to them and nurtured them through this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sponsoring orphans has many dimensions. In addition to the great reward of the Lord of the worlds, sponsoring orphans contributes to the reform of society when the orphan becomes a good individual and is protected from displacement and loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                What happens after the sponsorship: When you become a sponsor of the orphan, you will receive a photo of him, and after that you will receive regular reports about him to see the progress of the orphan’s progress first-hand, and the committee will make every effort to meet his living needs and improve his educational, educational, social and health conditions.
